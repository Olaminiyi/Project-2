# Deploying a LEMP Stack Application On AWS Cloud

A LEMP Stack application is an application which as opposed to a [LAMP Stack Application] (https://github.com/Olaminiyi/Project-1) makes use of Nginx as the web server for hosting the web application. NGINX is an open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more.
